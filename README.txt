Dial-A-Ride Experimentation Author: Patrick Davis 19'

Files:
DarpExperimentation.py -  This is the main file in which the algorithms are defined, and the main function runs them
                           and displays results in a graph

Graph.py -                This contains the graph class, which has methods to find the longest path, topologically sort,
                            and to check if there is a cycle

GraphGenerator.py -        This contains methods to create graphs to be tested on

requirements.txt -        This contains a list of all the packages that you will need. If you don't know how to set up
                            a virtual enviornment (to keep packages separated and organized), then I suggest watching:
                            https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5GVj5bqf9w
                            It is much easier than it sounds at first, and it makes it quick and easy to install
                            anything you need.
